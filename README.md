# Project Overview
wordshop is powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3. You can generate content with few words you input in either voice/speech or text!

#Description
GPT-3; a Large Language Model (LLM for short) is available to the public, with accessibility using OpenAIâ€™s APIs. As a result, since its release, OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 has been leveraged in over 300 applications/products. (source: [here](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/).

GPT-3 takes a text input as a prompt and performs the task of text completion by predicting one token at a time. What makes GPT-3 special is the scale at which it was built, possessing nearly 175B parameters.

The GPT-3 model expects a text prompt as an input.

I made "wordshop" a two- option thing. Voice/Speech & Direct Text. 

However, if to begin with speech, it's important to first convert speech to text and then feed the transcribed text as input to the GPT-3 model.

This is how GPT-3 model works ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ (download and add a couple of gif images from this link and credit the author)

To generate audio transcription, I will use AssemblyAIâ€™s speech-to-text transcription API.

The high-level workflow of the application is demonstrated in the image below:
